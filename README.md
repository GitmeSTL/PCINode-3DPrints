# PiPciprints

**A collection of PCI adaptable 3D prints for your Raspberry Pi-4**

**Built for any standard desktop PCI slot**


I have had great results printing these on both a DLP and my Ender3 Pro, the DLP may be able to print the smaller designs on the faceplate in higher detail. I use tiny machine screws to adhere the Pi to the print with a tiny bit of glue as the holes for the print line up but they are not threaded and pull out sometimes. I have used these prints in a standard computer case and I have never had overheating problems, however I have glued a fan on to the top of these and it works just fine too. 


**Feel free to use at your will but please don't sell them. 
Donations will keep me motivated to post more of my projects in the future âš¡**
