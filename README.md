# PiPciprints

**A collection of PCI adaptable 3D prints for your Raspberry Pi-4**

**Built for any standard desktop PCI slot**


I have had great results printing these on both my DLP and Ender3 Pro, the DLP may be able to print the smaller designs on the faceplate in higher detail. The print lines up perfectly with the Pi4 mounting points. I use tiny machine screws to adhere the Pi to the print, sometimes a tiny bit of glue will be required as the holes for the print are not threaded. I have used these in a standard computer case and I've never had overheating problems with normal ventaliation, however you can glue a fan onto your Pi's heat sink and it works great to keep the temps down by an additional 5F - 10F I'm also working on an STL with a fan mount included, I'll post it here later.
